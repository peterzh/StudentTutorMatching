# StudentTutorMatching
Google sheets/forms tool for matching students to tutors given provided preferences. Need accompanying google sheet (please contact for access).

Uses https://matchingtools.com/#tag/HRI for solving the matching itself. All code written here just reformats and creates google forms/sheets for entering the preferences and presenting the final assignments 

Also uses some JS utility functions from here: https://github.com/rgertenbach/Google-Apps-Script-Utilities/blob/master/Matrix%20Tools.gs
